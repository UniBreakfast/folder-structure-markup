# Folder Structure Markup

```
  └─📁folder
     ├─📁subfolder1
     │  ├─📁subfolder2
     │  └─📁subfolder3
     │     ├─📄file1.ext
     │     └─📄file2.ext
     └─📄file3.ext
```

This repo includes three functions to work with and present the folder structure of a project. The functions are:

- ### `readDirStructure()`
  Reads the folder structure at specified path and returns a tree object describing the folders and files therein.

- ### `makeDirStructure()`
  Creates a folder structure with initially empty files at specified path based on a tree object describing the folders and files therein.

- ### `stringifyDirStructure()`
  Presents the given folder structure in a human readable format. The markup generated by this function can be used in a documentation with monospace font to display the folder structure.

## Tree Object Format

To describe a folder structure, a tree object is used. The tree object is a nested object like this:

```js
const tree6 = { name: 'folder', children: [
  { name: 'subfolder1', children: [
    { name: 'subfolder2', children: [] },
    { name: 'subfolder3', children: [
      { name: 'file1' },
      { name: 'file2' },
    ] },
  ] },
  { name: 'file3' },
] }
```

where each node has a `name` property. If the node is a folder, it also has a `children` property which is an array of similar nodes with an arbitrary depth of nesting. Of course, any other kind of data structure could be used to describe a folder structure, but all functions in this repo expect the tree object to be in this format.

## Setup

Copy the functions you need from `structure.js` into your project. Then you can use them separately or in combination. For example, you can read a folder structure from a path and then present it in a human readable format or you can create a folder structure at a path based on a tree object describing the structure.

`readDirStructure()` and `makeDirStructure()` do require Node.js builtin modules `fs` and `path`, so make sure to import those in your project. `stringifyDirStructure()` does not require any additional modules.

## Usage Examples

### `readDirStructure()`

```js
const path = './folder' // optional, default is '.'
// or 'C:/folder'
// or 'C:\\folder\\subfolder'
// or '/home/username/folder'
// or './folder/subfolder'
// or '../../folder' etc.
const ignoreNames = ['.git', 'node_modules', '.DS_Store', '.vscode', '.gitignore'] // optional, default is []
const tree = readDirStructure(path, ignoreNames)
console.log(tree)

// will output a structure like in the example above
```
